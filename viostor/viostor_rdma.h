/*
 * viostor restricted-DMA-pool (rdmapool) support + bounce allocator + poll thread.
 *
 * In a Gunyah protected VM the virtio-blk backend can only touch memory that
 * lives in the restricted DMA pool (rdmapool). Normal guest pages handed to us
 * by StorPort are NOT device-visible, so every byte the device reads or writes
 * (vrings, out_hdr, status, and the I/O data itself) must be staged through
 * rdmapool memory. This module provides, in one place ("rdmapool allocator
 * unified management"):
 *
 *   - Connect/disconnect to the rdmapool driver (mirrors NetKVM ParaNdis_RdmaPool
 *     and the proven viostor pVM path), allocating one contiguous region that
 *     backs both the vrings and the bounce buffers.
 *   - A lock-free (SLIST) sub-allocator carving that region into fixed control
 *     slots (out_hdr + status) and large CONTIGUOUS data chunks. A chunk maps to
 *     a single virtqueue descriptor, so a large transfer costs ceil(len/chunk)
 *     descriptors instead of one-per-4KB-page.
 *   - A completion POLL THREAD that drains the used rings on a ~1ms cadence and
 *     blocks when idle, replacing the old inline busy-poll that wedged the
 *     StartIo thread. The hardware ISR stays the fast path; the poll thread is
 *     the deep-idle safety net for this platform's interrupt-wake latency.
