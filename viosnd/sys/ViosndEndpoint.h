 * device is `hda_fn_nid`, which the spec also uses to associate a stream with its jack and its
 * channel map -- so it, and not the stream's position in the list, is the device identity. The
 * two directions number their nids independently: output device 0 and input device 0 both
 * report nid 0.
 *
 * PortCls exposes one streaming pin per endpoint, so one stream per endpoint is taken. Where a
 * device offers several streams on the same nid the rest are surplus: real hardware uses them
 * for simultaneous playback into one converter, which is not something this driver does.
